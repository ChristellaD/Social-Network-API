# Social-Network-API

## Description
This project is a RESTful API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM. Additionally, the native JavaScript Date object is used to format timestamps.


## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Install dependencies. (Run 'npm i'.)


## Usage
- Run 'node index.js'.
The project contains POST, GET, DELETE, and PUT routes for users, thoughts, and reactions. It is recommended that these routes be tested in Insomnia. With these routes, the application will be able to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database. There is also functionality for adding and removing friends' from a user's friend list and creating reactions.

## Development
Contributions are welcome. Currently, the tests in Insomnia return a status of 404 (Not Found), as demonstrated in the video. In future commits, this issue will be resolved and the API should have full functionality.
